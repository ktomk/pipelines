### Font Awesome (Font Awesome Free License)

The [*Material for Mkdocs*][MKDOCS-MATERIAL] theme contains SVG files (named
*Icons* in the *Font Awesome Free License*) from the
[*Font Awesome - The iconic SVG, font, and CSS framework*][FONT-AWESOME]
project.

Some of these SVG files are put into the HTML output and used under license:

```
Font Awesome Free License
-------------------------

Font Awesome Free is free, open source, and GPL friendly. You can use it for
commercial projects, open source projects, or really almost whatever you want.
Full Font Awesome Free license: https://fontawesome.com/license/free.

# Icons: CC BY 4.0 License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
In the Font Awesome Free download, the CC BY 4.0 license applies to all icons
packaged as SVG and JS file types.

# Fonts: SIL OFL 1.1 License (https://scripts.sil.org/OFL)
In the Font Awesome Free download, the SIL OFL license applies to all icons
packaged as web and desktop font files.

# Code: MIT License (https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
In the Font Awesome Free download, the MIT license applies to all non-font and
non-icon files.

# Attribution
Attribution is required by MIT, SIL OFL, and CC BY licenses. Downloaded Font
Awesome Free files already contain embedded comments with sufficient
attribution, so you shouldn't need to do anything additional when using these
files normally.

We've kept attribution comments terse, so we ask that you do not actively work
to remove them from files, especially code. They're a great way for folks to
learn about Font Awesome.

# Brand Icons
All brand icons are trademarks of their respective owners. The use of these
trademarks does not indicate endorsement of the trademark holder by Font
Awesome, nor vice versa. **Please do not use brand logos for any purpose except
to represent the company, product, or service to which they refer.**

### Additional Credits

Some software that has no specific requirement when (indirectly) in use
to be made available nor noted, does not belong into the bill of
material. Nevertheless credit where credit is due.

#### Mkdocs Local-Search Plugin (MIT License)

The HTML documentation could not be build without the [*Mkdocs Local Search
Plugin*][MKDOCS-LOCALSEARCH] written by Lars Wilhelmer; [*A MkDocs plugin to
make the native "search" plugin work locally (file:// protocol)*]
[MKDOCS-LOCALSEARCH].

Its license does not require a notion *comme &ccedil;a* as the documentation is
already build (when shipped/published), nevertheless the build would not work
without it and a HTML documentation that works (static HTML is best served fresh
on platter) can not be taken for granted these days and requires notion.
